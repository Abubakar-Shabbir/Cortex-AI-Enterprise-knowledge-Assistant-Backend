"""
Enterprise Knowledge Center read-side queries.

The Knowledge Graph itself (Entity/EntityMention/Relationship) was built
in Sprint 5 for graph *retrieval* (graph_retrieval_service.py, folded
into hybrid search); this module is the UI-facing surface for it -
Topic exploration, relationship/graph views, insights, and a citation
viewer built from QueryLog.sources. Every function here is read-only.

Scoping - the single most important rule in this file
-------------------------------------------------------
Entity/Relationship rows carry a `user` FK, but that's the document
*uploader*, not "who's allowed to see this." Every function below
resolves visibility the same way graph_retrieval_service.py already
does for Ask AI: via EntityMention -> chunk -> document against
document_access_service.get_accessible_document_ids(user) (owned union
Organization Library union shared-with-them/their-role). NEVER filter
by Entity.user/Relationship.user directly - that was the bug this
module used to have (a user with Org Library/shared access to a
document they didn't personally upload saw that document surface in
Ask AI answers, but nothing about it in the Knowledge Center - the
opposite of what an enterprise knowledge tool should do).

Topics - merging across uploaders without a schema change
-----------------------------------------------------------
Entity stays deduplicated per-uploader (`unique_together = ("user",
"name", "entity_type")`) - there's no Organization/tenant model in
this codebase to hang a real cross-user merge on, and adding one is
out of scope for "improve this module." Instead, every listing/detail
function groups the *visible* Entity rows in Python by their
`(name, entity_type)` key - `Entity.name` is already the normalized
dedup key computed by graph_service._get_or_create_entity(), so two
different users' rows for "steve jobs"/PERSON carry the exact same
`name` and group together for free, no extra normalization needed.
The result is a **Topic**: a plain dict (not a new model) aggregating
mention_count/entity_ids/document_count across every constituent
Entity, regardless of who uploaded the source document. A Topic's
"id" for URL purposes is its top (most-mentioned) constituent
Entity's id, so the existing /knowledge/entity/<id>/ route needs no
change - get_topic_detail() resolves the rest of the group from there.
