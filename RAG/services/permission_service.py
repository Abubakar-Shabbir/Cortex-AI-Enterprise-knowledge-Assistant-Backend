Permission Service

Single source of truth for role/permission checks. Decorators
(RAG/decorators.py), middleware (RAG/middleware.py), context processors,
and views all go through this module rather than querying Role/UserRole
directly or branching on is_staff/is_superuser - so adding or changing
a role later never means touching more than the seed data
(RAG/management/commands/seed_rbac.py).

There is no "Super Admin" tier. Admin is the sole built-in top-tier
role and always has every permission (Role.has_permission's bypass in
RAG/models.py) - every other role, including the built-in "user", is
just data: created, edited, deleted, and granted permissions entirely
through Admin > Roles, with zero code changes required.
